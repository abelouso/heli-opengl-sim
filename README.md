RoadMap:
1> Get all choppers reliably delivering packages
2> Larger world (more difficult)
3> Make target landing zones clear of buildings
4> Make choppers look better (animate rotors)
5> Make choppers explode on crash
6> Implement collisions
  A> Land too hard -- crash
  B> Hit a building -- crash
  C> (Optional for now) -- hit another chopper -- crash

Future Tasks (No priority yet)
- Allow landing on buildings (non-zero altitude)
- Radar capability?
- Port ants into world
- Build the city with the choppers/ants
